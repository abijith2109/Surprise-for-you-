    <h1>My Love</h1>

    <p>
        From the day you walked into my life, everything started to feel warmer,
        brighter, and more meaningful. You are not just someone I love—you are
        the peace in my chaos, the smile in my hardest days, and the reason my
        heart feels full.
    </p>

    <p>
        When I think about my future, I don’t see places or things. I see you—
        walking beside me, laughing with me, growing old with me. I want to be
        there for every small moment and every big dream, to hold your hand
        through happiness and through storms.
    </p>

    <p>
        If life is a long journey, I don’t want to walk even a single step
        without you. I want my story to begin with you, continue with you, and
        gently reach its final chapter with you still beside me.
    </p>

    <p><strong>
        You are my today, my tomorrow, and the love I want until the very end of my life.
    </strong></p>
